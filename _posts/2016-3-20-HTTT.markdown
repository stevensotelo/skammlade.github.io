Fort Collins, CO is home to a thriving cycling scene. Your Group Ride hosts an annual time trial every Tuesday in April known as the [Horsetooth Time Trial Series][HTTT flyer]. The hilly 14.35 mile course runs along Horsetooth Reservoire and Horsetooth Mountain Park climbing a total of 1,336 feet.

This year will be it's sixth year running and in an attempt to encourage more women to give it a try I compiled data from the previous five years to see how rider participation has differed by gender:

Play around with the [race data][results] yourself (pulled from [YGR google docs][YGR drive]). *Note: the 2011 course differs from the 2012-2015 course and therefore times were omitted.
